# pokefriendme-django

This is a project to practice django.
This project is online at https://pokefriendme.herokuapp.com/ on Heroku as a simple project heavily inspired by https://www.pokemongofriendcodes.com/ but heavily simplified.
The goal of this project is to put to production a first django project, for practicing forms, validation, views, Q querys, pagination and deploying on heroku.


Front-end was not a concern during the development of this project.
